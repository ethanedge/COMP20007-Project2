# COMP20007-Project2
My project 2 from COMP20007 (Design of Algorithms), semester 1, 2020 @ The University of Melbourne.

Project aim: Working with hash functions and tree data structures

This was my second project for COMP20007 written in C. I had already done one subject with C beforehand, COMP10002 Foundations of Algorithms.

Check out the specification file to see the details of the project. Only the coding questions are included in this repository. Questions 3 and 4 are omitted. Test files are also included.

Take note that some files (main.c, Makefile) and some templates of files' (deque.c, hash.c, text_analysis.c) are written by the teaching staff and are not my work. My work is the functions that the spec outlines must be implemented by us.

This was developed before I used git hence the lack of commits.

*I'm pretty sure this is the final version of this program. If it is completely broken then I uploaded the wrong one. Thank god I know git now.*
